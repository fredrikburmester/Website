# fredrikburmester-django
> My own personal photography website build with Django.

[fredrikburmester.com](https://fredrikburmester.com)

## Info

This website was built with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), which uses Python in the backend. This website is hosted on my own local server with Nginx as the webproxy, which is also serving all static files. 

These are not all the files used by Django, but only the relevant code for the website. If you want to use the code or test it on your own machine I recommend starting a new Django project with the name *fredrikburmester* and create an app called albums. After that you can copy the code into your project.
